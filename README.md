## The Part where I Welcome You

I'll be honest I have no clue what I'm supposed to put here.

But **Markdown** is pretty neat, and so is **Jekyll**.

So can any github page have a markdown? The page I currently use is [Bitwise XOR Decryptor](https://megastardaboss.github.io/bitwise-decoder/) and it doesn't use markdown/jekyll at all. I don't even think it has a theme.
I would put the thinking emoji there, but I can't find the effort to open this on my phone for one emoji.

## The Part With Lists

I've read you can do pretty cool lists here. So here are some lists :

* My Personal Website [34.194.108.205](http://34.194.108.205/)
* My Personal Website now with a URL [schwastuff.me](http://schwastuff.me/)
* My Github Page [Megastardaboss](https://github.com/Megastardaboss)

That's pretty good! üëç
See, *now* I'll put in the effort for emojis.
Earlier I was stupid and didn't think to copy-paste one from the interwebs.

## The Part where Coding is Spooky Witchcraft

Here's the deal: coding is witchcraft. Those who code should be tried for meddling in dark magic.
Coding is spooky. Non-programmers can't understand.

Someone can *PRINT "HELLO WORLD"?!*
...

Black magic!

Someone can *make a cat named Smokey appear in Sepia?!*
...

Evil interference!

Well now I sound insane, let's hope nobody reads this.
